This program is a rewrite of an Add Two Large Number source I found from a 
website called geeksforgeeks.org writen by Danish Raza.

I rewrote the program for Apple One BASIC. Apple One BASIC is extremely limited
as it is only able to process Integers from  -32767 to 32767. I wanted to find a
way to add two whole numbers of any length on the Apple One in BASIC. The 
methods I found from Danish Raza helped very much with that.

You can find the [original version](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-two-large-numbers/)
You can run the code from Apple 1js Emulator from [Sculinsteel](https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple1/)

Thank you to Danish Raza, Will Scullin, and The Woz
